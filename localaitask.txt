# Commands for the local AI to install dependencies
# These steps assume offline packages for .NET SDK 8.0 are available.

# 1. Copy the .NET SDK 8.0 installation files into the container, e.g. under /tmp/dotnet.
# 2. Install the packages. For Debian based systems it may look like:
# sudo dpkg -i /tmp/dotnet/*.deb
# 3. Verify the installation:
# dotnet --version

# Once the SDK is installed you can run:
# dotnet restore
# dotnet build
# dotnet test
