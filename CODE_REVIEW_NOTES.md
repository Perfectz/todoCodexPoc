## Areas for Further Discussion

1. **Data Persistence**: The current implementation uses SQLite locally. Consider discussing cloud sync options.

2. **Error Handling**: The app shows simple alerts for errors. Consider a more robust logging and error reporting mechanism.

3. **UI Responsiveness**: Testing on different device sizes and orientations is needed.

4. **Performance**: For large todo lists, consider implementing virtualization or paging.

5. **Accessibility**: Ensure the app is usable with screen readers and other accessibility tools.
